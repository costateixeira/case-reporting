    There are three actors defined in this implementation guide which are guide to respond to two <a href="#transactions">transactions</a>
    <dl>
      <dt>Case Report Submitter</dt>
      <dd>The Case Report Submitter is responsible for submitting a case report to a Case Report Transformer.  There are three options for the Submit Case Report transaction that a Case Reporter may use for submission of case reports depending on their maturity levels</dd>

      <dt>Case Report Transfomer</dt>
      <dd>The Case Report Transformer is reponsible to perform any neccesary transformation of case reports received from a Case Report Submitter via the Submit Case Report transaction into the requisite Case Report form to be sent into the Case Report Repository via the Store Case Report  transaction.  The Case Report Transformer must be able to repond to all three options for the Submit Case Report transaction. A Case Report Transformer should also be responsible for ensuring security and auditing according to the ATNA profile.</dd>
      
      <dt>Case Report Reposistory</dt>
      <dd>The Case Report Repository is responsible for receiving case reports from the Case Report Transformer and storing those case reports for futher analysis and use in a data warehouse (generic FHIR server).  The specific use of the case reports in the Case Report Repository is beyond the scope of this implementation guide as it will depend on the specific disease area.</dd>
