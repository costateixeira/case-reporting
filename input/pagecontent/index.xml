  <h3>Summary</h3> <a name="summary"> </a>

  <p>

    <p>
      This Implementation Guide contains the full set of specifications for general case reporting workflows. It has been developed to support case reporting as part of the <a href="usecase_1.html">public health response</a> use case.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Implementation Guide is intended to be supplemented by one or more <a href="content_profiles.html">content profiles</a> guides developed for specific health program areas which will define the details of the case report.  Examples of such content guides include:
      <ul>
	<li><a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/openhie/hiv-ig/index.html">HIV </a></li>
	<li><a href="https://openhie.github.io/covid-ig/">Covid-19</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>


    <p>
      This Implementation Guide defines three <a href="actors.html">actors</a> involved in the submission of a case report into a case report repository.  These actors engage in the <a href="transactions.html">transactions</a> to submit, transform and store case reports into a case report repository.

  <h3>Intellectual Property Considerations</h3>  <a name="ip"> </a>
  <p>
    While this implementation guide and the underlying FHIR are licensed as public domain, this guide may include examples making use of terminologies such 
    as LOINC, SNOMED CT and others which have more restrictive licensing requirements. Implementers should make themselves familiar with licensing and 
    any other constraints of terminologies, questionnaires, and other components used as part of their implementation process. In some cases, 
    licensing requirements may limit the systems that data captured using certain questionnaires may be shared with.
