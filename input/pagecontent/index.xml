  <h3>Summary</h3> <a name="summary"> </a>

  <p>
    This implementation guide contains the full set of specifications for general case reporting workflows.  These workflows are designed for reporting system operating at a variety of FHIR <a href="#maturity">maturity levels.</a>
    
    There are three <a href="#actors">actors </a> (Case Report Submitter, Case Report Transformer, and Case Report Repository) involved in two case report <a href="#transaction">transactions</a>.

    </figure>
    
    This Implementation Guide is intended to be supplemented by one or more <i>content</i> guides developed for specific health program areas which will define the details of the case report.  Examples of such content guides include:
    <ol>
      <li><a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/openhie/hiv-ig/index.html">HIV </a></li>
      <li><a href="https://openhie.github.io/covid-ig/">Covid-19</a></li>
    </ol>
  </p>


  <h4>Dependencies</h4><a name="dependencies"> </a>
  <p>
    This Implementation Guide depends on the following standards and profiles:


    <dl>
      <dt><a href="https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/ITI/IHE_ITI_Suppl_SVCM.pdf">IHE SVCM</a></dt>
      <dd><i>FHIR Aware</i> and <i>FHIR Native</i> case reporting systems should use SVCM to synchronize value sets used for reporting (e.g. disaggregators/stratifiers) and to specify concept maps between local code systems and required reporting value sets.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt><a href="https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/ITI/IHE_ITI_Suppl_mCSD.pdf">mCSD</a></dt>
      <dd><i>FHIR Aware</i> and <i>FHIR Native</i> case reporting systems should use mCSD to synchorinze location data  (e.g. health facility, site, community, distrct, region) use for reporting</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt><a href="https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Audit_Trail_and_Node_Authentication">ATNA</a></dt>
      <dd>Used by the Case Report Transformer to  provide patient information confidentiality, data integrity and user accountability.   </dd>
    </dl>
    
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/index.html">SDC</a></dt>
      <dd>Under the FHIR-Aware option, a Case Report Transformer should use <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/extraction.html#definition-extract">Definition Based Extract</a>, defined in  Structured Data Capture, to transform a incoming case report Questionnaire resource into a Composition resource before submitting to the Case Report Repository.</dd>      
    </dl>


    <dl>
      <dt>Data Analysis (forthcoming) </dt>
      <dd>Recommended Implementation Guide for providing a platform for  business intelligence tools used for further data analysis and use of case report forms.</dd> 
    </dl>
  </p>
  
  

  <h4>Maturity Levels</h4><a name="maturity"></a>
  <p>
    <dl>
      <dt>FHIR Naive</dt>
      <dd>Existing tool with limited resources or desire to upgrade to include FHIR support.  Have back-end access to database or way to generate tabular reports.  </dd>

      <dt>FHIR Aware</dt>
      <dd>Basic FHIR Questionnaire support available for simple data exports from template reports.  Can initiate FHIR API calls.  Metadata synchronized using IHE profiless (SVCM, mCSD)</dd>

      <dt>FHIR Native</dt>
      <dd>Full FHIR stack, data model and supporting tools are within the system.  Can generate robust FHIR resources and data models and metadata has been synchronized using IHE profiles (SVCM, mCSD)</dd>
    </dl>

    
  </p>



  <h4>Actors</h4><a name="actors"></a>
  <p>
    There are three actors defined in this implementation guide which are guide to respond to two <a href="#transactions">transactions</a>
    <dl>
      <dt>Case Report Submitter</dt>
      <dd>The Case Report Submitter is responsible for submitting a case report to a Case Report Transformer.  There are three options for the Submit Case Report transaction that a Case Reporter may use for submission of case reports depending on their maturity levels</dd>

      <dt>Case Report Transfomer</dt>
      <dd>The Case Report Transformer is reponsible to perform any neccesary transformation of case reports received from a Case Report Submitter via the Submit Case Report transaction into the requisite Case Report form to be sent into the Case Report Repository via the Store Case Report  transaction.  The Case Report Transformer must be able to repond to all three options for the Submit Case Report transaction. A Case Report Transformer should also be responsible for ensuring security and auditing according to the ATNA profile.</dd>
      
      <dt>Case Report Reposistory</dt>
      <dd>The Case Report Repository is responsible for receiving case reports from the Case Report Transformer and storing those case reports for futher analysis and use in a data warehouse (generic FHIR server).  The specific use of the case reports in the Case Report Repository is beyond the scope of this implementation guide as it will depend on the specific disease area.</dd>
    </dl>
  </p>


  <h4>Transactions</h4><a name="transactions"></a>
  <p>
    There are two transactions defined by this implementaiton guide:
    <dl>
      <dt>Submit Case Report</dt>
      <dd>
	The Submit Case Report transaction is initiated by the Case Report Submitter based on periodically defined report time, when triggered by a sentinel event, or in batch when online. There are three options for the Submit Case Report transaction defined by the <a href="#maturity">maturity level</a> of the Case Report Submitter.  The  Case Report Transformer has a set of <a href="expected_actions">expected actions</a> to take depending on the option
      </dd>

      <dt>Store Case Report</dt>
      <dd>The Store Case Report transaction is initiated by the Case Report Transfomer after processing a case report form received from a Case Report Submitter.  The Case Report Transformer sends a Transaction Bundle to the Case Report Repository which stores the resources for later user and analysis. </dd>
    </dl>
  </p>

  
  <h4>Expected Actions</h4><a name="expected actions"></a>
  <p>
    For the Submit Case Report transaction there are three options defined for differing <a href="#maturity">maturity</a> levels of a Case Report Submitter.  These options have the following expected actions:
    <dl>
      <dt>FHIR Naive</dt>
      <dd>
	This Case Report Submitter submits a tabular data set, associated to a Questionnaire resource, to the Case Report Transformer as a CSV file.  The method of transmission is unspecified and a case Report Transformer may choose to accept other variants of tabular data (e.g. excel spreadsheet)..
	The Case Report Transformer must:
	<ol>
	  <li>Retrieve a ConceptMap, using SVCM, which associates the column names in the tabular data to a Questionnaire item</li>
	  <li>Receive a tabular data from a Case Report Submitter</li>
	  <li>
	    For each row of tabular data:
	    <ol>
	      <li>Map the data row into a QuestionnaireResponse using a ConceptMap to map column names of the tabular data into QuestionnaireItems (<b>Need Vlad's details</b>)</li>
	      <li>Extract relevant resouces into a Composition resource into a QuestionnaireResponse using <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/extraction.html#definition-extract">Definition Based Extract</a> as defined within the corresponding Questionnaire resource (the equivalent of the $extract operation)</li>
	      <li>Create a Provenance resource linking the QuestionnaireResponse to the extracted Composition resource</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Convert the submitted tabular data into a Binary resource (<b>do we need?</b>)</li>
	  <li>Create a Provenance resource linking the Binary resource (as an entity) to the Composition resources generated</li>
	  <li>Submit the ?Binary?, QuestionnaireReponse, Composition and Provenance resources to the Case Report Submitter as a Transaction Bundle</li>
	</ol>
      </dd>

      <dt>FHIR Aware</dt>
      <dd>
	In this transaction, the Case Report Submitter submits one or more a Case Report form as a QuestionnaireResponse resources to the Case Report Transformer.  The Case Report Submitter may submit this as a an individual QuestionnaireResponse resouce or as multiple QuestionnaireResponses resouces within a Transaction Bundle. The Case Report Transformer must:
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    For each QuestionnaireResponse:
	    <ol>
	      <li>Extract relevant resouces into a Composition resource using <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/extraction.html#definition-extract">Definition Based Extract</a> as defined within the corresponding Questionnaire resource (the equivalent to the SDC $extract operation)</li>
	      <li>Create a Provenance resource linking the QuestionnaireResponse to the extracted Composition resource</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Submit the QuestionnaireResponse, Composition and Provenance resources to the Case Report Submitter as a ?Transaction Bundle?</li>
	</ol>
      </dd>

      <dt>FHIR Native</dt>
      <dd>In this transaction, the Case Report Submitter submits one or more  Case Report forms as a Composition resources to the Case Report Transformer.  The Case Report Submitter may submit this as a an individual Composition resource  or multiple Composition resources within a Transaction Bundle. The Case Report Transformer is not expected to modify the message received from the Case Report Submitter. The Case Report Transformer must:
      <ol>
	<li>Submit the Composition resources to the Case Report Submitter as a ?Transaction Bundle?</li>
      </ol></dd>

    </dl>
    
    The Case Report Transformer should perform the following actions:
    <ul>
      <li>Record the transaction in the audit log using ATNA</li>
    </ul>

    The Case Report Transformer may perform any of the following actions:
    <ul>
      <li>Resolve local value sets into the expected value sets using a Concept Map, as defined by SVCM</li>
      <li>Validate any codes used in the case report form</li>
      <li>Resolve local identifiers for location using a canonical identifier, as defined by mCSD</li>
      <li>Validate any location identifiers against a facility directory, as defined by mCSD</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Intellectual Property Considerations</h3>  <a name="ip"> </a>
  <p>
    While this implementation guide and the underlying FHIR are licensed as public domain, this guide includes examples making use of terminologies such 
    as LOINC, SNOMED CT and others which have more restrictive licensing requirements. Implementers should make themselves familiar with licensing and 
    any other constraints of terminologies, questionnaires, and other components used as part of their implementation process. In some cases, 
    licensing requirements may limit the systems that data captured using certain questionnaires may be shared with.
