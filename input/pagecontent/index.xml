  <h3>Introduction</h3> <a name="intro"> </a>

  <p>
    This Implementation Guide contains the base specifications for general case reporting pipeline. It has been developed to support case reporting as part of the use cases like <a href="usecase_1.html">public health response</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This IG is a common architecture IG - it describes the architecture and workflows for case reporting. It does not provide any specific content requirements or constraints, because those would be purpose-specific and depending on several factors like the condition they are targeting.
    This Implementation Guide is intended to be supplemented by one or more <a href="content_profiles.html">content profiles</a> guides developed for specific health program areas which will define the details of the case report.  Examples of such content guides include:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/openhie/hiv-ig/index.html">HIV </a></li>
      <li><a href="https://openhie.github.io/covid-ig/">Covid-19</a></li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    This Implementation Guide is underpinned by supporting <a href="references.html">guidelines, policies and recommendations</a>
  </p>

  <h3>Summary</h3> <a name="summary"> </a>

  <p>
    This Implementation Guide defines the standard interoperability mechanisms that can be used for different types of case reporting. It provides implementers the key architectural modules that can be implemented in their systems, to support a standard interoperability framework.</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    This Implementation Guide defines three <a href="actors.html">actors</a> involved in the submission of a case report into a case report repository - which can be done using individual forms, bulk data import, or direct interfaces. These actors engage in the <a href="transactions.html">transactions</a> to submit, transform and store case reports into a case report repository. This implementation guide describes the expectations for exchanging and transforming the data.
    This Implementation Guide also provides the foundational specifications - profiles, value sets, behaviour requirements, etc. that are expected in implementations.    
  </p>
  <p>
    Choosing from these actors and associated transactions, implementers can bootstrap their Case Reporting implementations, typically by creating (and usually enhancing) the reference content specifications - HIV, COVID-19, others.

  <h3>Intellectual Property Considerations</h3>  <a name="ip"> </a>
  <p>
    While this implementation guide and the underlying FHIR are licensed as public domain, this guide may include examples making use of terminologies such 
    as LOINC, SNOMED CT and others which have more restrictive licensing requirements. Implementers should make themselves familiar with licensing and 
    any other constraints of terminologies, questionnaires, and other components used as part of their implementation process. In some cases, 
    licensing requirements may limit the systems that data captured using certain questionnaires may be shared with.

  <p>
    This specification is provided without warranty of completeness or consistency, and the official publication supersedes this draft.
    No liability can be inferred from the use or misuse of this specification, or its consequences.
