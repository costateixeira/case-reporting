    This Implementation Guide contains the full set of specifications for general case reporting workflows. It has been developed to support case reporting as part of the <a href="usecase_1.html">public health response</a> use case.

    This Implementation Guide is intended to be supplemented by one or more <i>content</i> guides developed for specific health program areas which will define the details of the case report.  Examples of such content guides include:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/openhie/hiv-ig/index.html">HIV </a></li>
      <li><a href="https://openhie.github.io/covid-ig/">Covid-19</a></li>
    </ul>


    This Implementation Guide defines three <a href="actors.html">actors</a> involved in the submission of a case report into a case report repository.  These actors engage in the <a href="transactions.html">transactions</a> to submit, transform and store case reports into a case report repository.
